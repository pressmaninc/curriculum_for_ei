### step 1.

This template uses `PLACEHOLDERS` such as `COLUMN_NAME` throughout the file names and code. Use the following list of placeholders to do a 'find and replace':

* `PLUGIN_NAME`: Single-word, no spaced. Underscores allowed. Used for the text-domain and plugin description.
* `CUSTOM_NAMESPACE`: Single-word, no spaced. Underscores allowed. Used for the namespace declarations in the different class files.
* `COLUMN_NAME`: Single-word, no spaces. Underscores allowed. eg. donate_button
* `COLUMN_LABEL`: Multiple words, can include spaces, visible when selecting a column
* `PLUGIN_URL`: Url to the github or WordPress repository
* `PLUGIN_TAGS`: Comma separated list of relevant tags
* `DESCRIPTION`: Brief description of the field type, no longer than 2 lines
* `EXTENDED_DESCRIPTION`: Extended description of the field type
* `AUTHOR_NAME`: Name of field type author
* `AUTHOR_URL`: URL to author's website

### step 2.

Edit the `ac-PLUGIN_NAME.php` file (now renamed using your plugin name) and change the column type if necessary.

### step 3.

Edit the `COLUMN_NAME.php` files (now renamed using your column name) and include your custom code in the appropriate functions.

### step 4.

Edit this `README.md` file with the appropriate information and delete all content above and including the following line.

### step 5 (optional).

The structure of this plugin is prepared so that it can contain multiple columns.
If you want to create multiple custom columns in this plugin, you can create a copy of each of the files and use a different name for your files that represents the column classes.
